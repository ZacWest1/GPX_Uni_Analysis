# GPX_Uni_Analysis
A three (3) part assessment I completed within the subject "Data Science" at Macquarie University recieving a High Distiction (HD) grade.

In part one, I was given 5 different GPX time stamped files (found in the folder "files"). In the years 2016 and 2019 there was a road race (RR) and a time trial race (TT). We have data from road races and time trials from both 2016 and 2019. We were tasked with analysisng the data to find information, trends and answer questions.

Part two involved the analysis of federal government issued kids sport participation vouchers againsts socioeconomic statuses.

The third part involed taking customer data from a telecommunications company and building a predictive model on weather customers would leave the provider or not.
